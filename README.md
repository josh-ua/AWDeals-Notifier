# AWDeals-Notifier

Simple Python script that will alert you via text message when 'Amazon Warehouse Deals' shows up in the sellers section of a listing. Very basic right now and only supports watching one item. Requires python3.0+

Requires the 'twilio' and 'requests' python libraries (get via pip or easy install). To run, input your twilio info and the product's seller page (use a link shortening serivce to shorten this as this will be texted to you) and a custom name in the config.py. Then run the driver.
